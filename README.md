CSU Spring 2021 Modern Physics Python Tutorial

Welcome to PH 315 for Spring 2021 at Colorado State University!

For most of our data analysis in this course, we'll be using Python. Python is a multi-purpose programming language that is open-source and free to use. It is commonly used in a wide variety of industries and is similar to Matlab. In this course, we'll be using Google Colab as a free browser based version of a Python environment. You'll be able to upload data to Google Drive and import it into these Colab notebooks when you need to analyze it.

We're not going to cover a lot of basic Python nitty-gritty details (like data types) and will instead focus on the tools you'll need for this class. We will then provide a framework that you will finish for each lab. If you'd like more info on basic Python, we'll provide some links to resources or feel free to ask!
